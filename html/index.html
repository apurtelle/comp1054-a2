            THE DREADNOUGHTS

            Your eyes were filled with stars <br>
            So you picked up a guitar <br>
            And how the people gave <br>
            The attention that you crave <br>
            Tonight, the stage is yours <br>
            But the world has watched you rise <br>
            And fall a thousand times before <br>
            <span class="polka_never_dies">Polka never dies</span> <br><br>
    
            So when your face is gone <br>
            The dance will carry on <br>
            And you'll rot down in your grave <br>
            With the souls you couldn't save <br>
            Tonight, the stage was yours <br>
            How they loved your moans and sighs <br>
            But oh, the reaper loved you more <br>
            <span class="polka_never_dies">Polka never dies</span> <br><br>
    
            Come all you indie hipster darlings <br>
            And new pop country starlings, <br>
            To the main street legion hall <br>
            Look into my crystal ball <br><br>
            
            Emo, screamo, <span class="polka_never_dies">POLKA NEVER DIES</span> <br>
            Last call, Dance hall, <span class="polka_never_dies">POLKA NEVER DIES</span> <br>
            You'll be the first against the wall <br>
            And <span class="polka_never_dies">Polka never dies</span>  <br>
            You are the first against the wall <br>
            And <span class="polka_never_dies">Polka never dies</span> <br>
